# Compiler-design
<p> This project is focused to build a customized compiler for a customized programming language using <b>Flex</b> and <b>Bison</b>.
<br>
I got idea for <b>tokens</b> from other high level language like <i>C++, Java</i>, language like <i>SQL</i>and low level language like <i>Assembly language used for 8086</i>. Main goal was reduce the usage of keyboard's numpad.
I have a goal to develop my own programming language in near future which will be easier to type and read for next gen programmers!
